1. Unzip the provided compressed folder in a directory under your user's root
2. Ensure you have:
   a PHP version >= 7.2.11
   APACHE 2.X >= installed
   MySQL 5.X >= installed
   A MySQL compatible SQL console

   On Windows, these can all be downloaded in the XAmpp bundle, available here:
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/7.2.11/
       Make sure to install Xampp in your user's directory, rather than in C:\Program....

3. Configure/create new MySQL database with the following credentials:
    host=desiredHostName
    port=3306;
    dbname=izc353_2
    user=izc353_2
    pwd=BYnAgh

4. Take note of where the unzipped CON-Project folder resides
   example:
        if the file structure looks like:
            /home/user/docs/a-dir/another-dir/CON-Project/src
        the pathName used throughout the rest of these instruction must be:
            /home/user/docs/a-dir/another-dir
            {the folder where CON-Project resides}

5. Configure APACHE by doing the following

    sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/izc353_2.conf

    in the editor, enter the following, replacing pathName with the actual pathName
        (for pathName, see step 4)
    -------------------------------

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin anyone@encs.concordia.ca
        ServerName local-group18-comp-353.concordia.ca

        DocumentRoot "pathName"
        <Directory "pathName">
            Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
            AllowOverride all
            Order Deny,Allow
            Allow from all
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

    -------------------------------
    save this

6. Configure your hosts to route requests to the serverName you configured in step 5
    enter the following command:

    sudo vim /etc/hosts

    in the editor, add the following line, replacing serverName with the serverName entered in step 5

    -------------------------------

    127.0.0.1   serverName

    -------------------------------



7. go to the folder chosen for pathName from step 4
   enter the following command:

    vim .htaccess

    in the editor, input the following, where
         desiredHostName is the same as what it was in step 3

    -------------------------------


    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} ^$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    # RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /CON-Project/index.php [QSA,L]
    SetEnv DATABASE_URL "mysql:host=desiredHostName;port=3306;dbname=izc353_2"
    SetEnv DATABASE_USERNAME "izc353_2"
    SetENV DATABASE_PWD "BYnAgh"

    -------------------------------

    save this file


8. In your preferred MySQL console, login to the database created in step 3.
    copy and paste the located script in:

    /CON-Project/dbdumps/dump-MASTER.sql

    execute the script. this will create the tables and populate them with info

9. run the following command:
    sudo systemctl restart apache2

10. navigate to the serverName set in step 5, this should now display the home page!
        login info for the users created with the db script can be found in:

        /CON-Project/db_scripts/users.json

        the default superuser account information for logging in is:
            email: superuser@dummy.com
            password: resurepus
